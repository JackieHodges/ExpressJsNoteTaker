# 11 Express.js: Note Taker
Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator


## Description

This application, Note Taker, had a pre-written front end elements and JavaScript, but needed the addition of an Express.js back end that would allow for the saving and retriving of note data from a JSON file. This was completed using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html).

When the application is first opened, the landing page is shown with a link to the notes page. Once the link is selected, the notes page appears with existing notes on the lefthand side and the ability to create a new note on the righthand side. 

If a new note begins to be written, the save icon appears at the top of the page. Once the save button is clicked, that note then appears on the lefthand side with the other existing notes. A user can begin writting a new note by clicking on the Write icon at the top of the screen.

If a existing note is selected, the contents of the notes then appear on the righthand side.

After the back-in was built, I connected to the front end, and deployed to Heroku.
